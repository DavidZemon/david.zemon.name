                <h2>Grade Sheet - Current Revision: 1.3.4</h2>
                <a href="gradeSheetChangeLog.shtml">See the change log</a>

                <p>Tired of your professor/teacher never updating the class website with your grades? I sure am. I've
                    created a spreadsheet that is very easy and quick to use, which will help you keep track of your
                    grades, without depending on your prof to update Angel or whatever website they (don't) use.</p>

                <a href="http://david.zemon.name/downloads/Grade_Sheet-1.3.4.xltx">Microsoft Office Excel</a>

                <p>I tried to use column headings and labels that are self-explanatory, but if you need help using the
                    form, feel free to either ask me or read the instructions below.
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-size: small;">Note: Older file-types available upon request.</span>
                </p>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>

                <div id="lists">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Setup:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Find the course syllabus for each of your classes. The syllabus lists the weight of
                                    each type of assignment (Ex. Homework: 20%, Tests: 40%, Final: A lot%)
                                </li>

                                <li>Open the grade sheet and go to File -&#62; Save (or Control + S) and rename the file
                                    with the name of one of your courses. Continue doing a Save As for each of your
                                    courses, so that you have one file for each course.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>Fill in each of the boxes labeled "Weight" with the percent listed in your syllabi. Check
                            for typos by looking at the weight of the final - it is automatically calculated.
                            <br>
                            <small>By now, you may have noticed that not all cells can be selected. This is to keep you
                                from accidentally editing a formula. There is no password on the protection, so if you
                                know what you're doing, feel free to edit whatever you need. Please let me know, as I'd
                                love to find some way to incorporate your changes into my next revision.
                            </small>
                        </li>

                        <li>If you have special items such as attendance or projects, the Miscellaneous section is a
                            good place to put them. Enter in the weight of each misc. item and under "Grade (%)" enter
                            in the percentage grade you received, <i>not</i> the number of points.
                        </li>

                        <li>The bolded cell titled "Grade before final" takes into account all grades (including those
                            in Misc.) except for your final. This now works <b>all</b> of the time. Thanks to some
                            hidden formulas in the document, sections of the class that have not yet been graded, such
                            as projects or attendance, will not be taken into account.
                        </li>

                        <li>The subsections of "Grade before final" are rather useless to be honest. They tell you how
                            many percentage points each section of your work gives to your total grade (including
                            final). For instance, if your homework average is an 80%, and it is worth 20% of your
                            overall grade, "From Homework" will read 16%.
                        </li>

                        <li>Note: The next two sections will have the greatest accuracy only when all sections of your
                            grade contain something. If a project has yet to be completed, try entering what you expect
                            to receive for that project.
                        </li>

                        <li>In "Desired Grade", enter the grade you would like to receive in the class. The following
                            cell tells you, with the current points you've received throughout the class, what grade you
                            must get on your final to achieve your goal. If it's bolded and red, you're screwed.
                        </li>

                        <li>Further down is a cell, "Expected grade". Here you may enter what you expect to get on the
                            final, and the following cell tells you what grade this will result in. If it is bolded and
                            red, this means your expected grade is not high enough to achieve your desired grade. Study
                            up!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
