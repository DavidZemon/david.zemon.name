					<h3>What is Maple</h3>
					
					<p>Maple is a calculator. More specifically, Maple is a calculator on really strong steroids. The 
					kind that make scrawny wimpy kids into huge football players. Or... your computer into the biggest 
					and baddest calculator you've ever seen. Type one quick command and Maple will solve an integral. 
					Type another command and it will solve a system of equations, or matrix multiplication. Another 
					command solves any differential equation you can come up with. Maple makes your TI-84 look like 
					your dad's sliderule (no offense to sliderules... they come in handy from time to time).</p>
					
					<h3>First Time Setup</h3>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Open Maple. If there is a window with one of those check boxes that make it never show up 
						again... I suggest clicking the check box.</li>
						<li>At the top menu, choose "Tools -&#62; Options"</li>
						<li>Choose the third tab "Interface"</li>
						<li>Select the drop down menu with description: "Default format for new worksheets" and choose 
						"Worksheet" instead of the default, "Document"</li>
						<li>At the bottom, click "Apply globally"</li>
						<li>Close Maple and reopen it</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>In the days to come I will post instructions for getting started with Maple. Commands to try and 
					tricks to making maple not hate you (as much). For those of you with programming experience, think of 
					Maple as just another programming language. Learn the language and you'll do fine.</p>
					<p>To start, try using simple calculator commands that you might use on a TI-30 or the like. If you 
					need something more complex, use the graphical functions in the left-hand tool bar. If you have specific 
					questions, as always, feel free to contact me via the link at the bottom.</p>
