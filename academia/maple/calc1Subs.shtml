					<h3>Calculus 1/Algebra: Subs</h3>

					<p>Substituting in values is another one of the most commonly used Maple commands. Who wants to find
						f(0), f(1), f(2), and f(3) for f(x) = (x^2 + 32x + 56) / (x^3 + 45x + 8) with their calculator?
						Yea... not me. Try this:</p>

					<blockquote id="code">
						restart
						<br>
						f:=(x^2 + 32x + 56) / (x^3 + 45x + 8)
						<br>
						subs(x=0,f)
						<br>
						subs(x=1,f)
						<br>
						subs(x=2,f);subs(x=3,f)
					</blockquote>

					<p>The subs command also takes two arguments: the variable and its new value, and what function you
						want to perform this substitution on.</p>

					<p>Also take notice of the colon in the last line. The colon is used to tell Maple you're done with
						a command and ready to start another. In this case, I wanted to type both substitutions on one
						line. Another common place to use this is when given multiple values in a problem. Let's talk
						quadratic equations:</p>

					<blockquote id="code">
						restart
						<br>
						f:=a*x^2 + b*x + c
						<br>
						subs({a=1,b=32,c=56},f)
						<br>
						solve(subs({a=1,b=32,c=56},f))
						<br>
						f
						<br>
						a:=1;b:=32;c:=56
						<br>
						solve(f)
					</blockquote>

					<p>Notice first that the substitution of the subs command is not permanent. If values are
						substituted in one command, they will revert back to their variable name in the following
						command - be it on the same line or not. Also note that, like the solve command, curly brackets
						can surround an argument, allowing you to substitute in multiple values at once. A third piece
						to notice in this section is the use of "nested commands". Nested commands are highly
						discouraged, as they can make your work very hard to read. Though it is possible to write an
						entire assignment in one line of code, your teacher or professor would never forgive you (or
						give you any points for that matter).</p>
