					<h3>Printing</h3>

					<h4>Note: These instructions were written for printers on Rose-Hulman's campus. If you are not a
						Rose-Hulman student, this may or may not work for you. I will work on writing instructions for
						MS&amp;T students soon.</h4>

					<p>One of the most common mistakes when printing Maple worksheets is forgetting to expand all
						headings. Your worksheet will print exactly as you see it on your screen, collapsed headings and
						all. The easiest way to fix is this is by going to View -&#62; Expand all sections.</p>

					<p>In general, print-outs of Maple look much better when done 2 per side of paper. If you're using
						your own personal computer, you'll have to find the settings for yourself. If you're on the Rose
						network, I'm going to try and help you out. For each of the below examples, you must go to File
						-&#62; Print, and then choose "Properties" from the Printer dialogue box to access the printer
						properties listed below.</p>

					<h4>Printer Style 1</h4>

					<p>This is one of the more common types of printers on campus. It's also the easiest. If you can get
						to a screen similar to this one (the default "Printing shortcuts" may differ) then you're in
						luck - all you gotta do is create your own printer shortcut.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>With "Default" selected, choose "Save as" at the bottom. Name the new shortcut, Maple.
						</li>
						<li>Select your new shortcut, and change the "Pages per sheet" option to 2.</li>
						<li>Choose "Save as" again, and keep the same file name (or change it if you wish - not like the
							file name makes a difference in functionality).
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h4>Printer Style 2</h4>

					<p>The other common printer a bit simpler, though not as intuitive. If when you choose "Properties"
						from the printer dialogue, you see the following window, all you must do is choose "Finishing"
						at the top and select "2 pages per sheet" in the middle of the dialalogue box.</p>
