					<h3>Calculus 1/Algebra: Solve</h3>
					
					<p>Let's take a look back at our last problem: 4x/57-80=0. Rather than go through the steps of 
					solving this ourselves, Maple has a command to solve this problem automatically. Try the following:</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart;
						<br>solve(4x/57-80=0,x)
						<br>f:=5x^2+4x+7=0
						<br>solve(f,x)
					</blockquote>
					<p>Breakdown of the solve command: solve -- name of the command, () -- everything within the outer-most 
					parenthesis will be evaluated by solve, 4x/57-80=0 -- this is the function to be solved, x -- this is the
					variable we are solving for.</p>
					
					<blockquote id="code">
						g:=x^2+2x+1
						<br>solve(g)
					</blockquote>
					<p>Sometimes, you don't need both arguments of the solve command. When solving an equation with only one variable, 
					entering the second argument is unnecessary, as Maple will automatically know which variable to solve for. If 
					your function does not have an equals sign, Maple will assume it is equal to zero.</p>
					
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart;
						<br>f:=2x+3y=4
						<br>g:=5x+4y=7
						<br>solve({f,g},{x,y})
					</blockquote>
					<p>Here, we have a system of equations. Solve still takes only two "arguments" which is a programming 
					term for pieces, or parts. Solve has two parts - what you're solving, and what you're solving for. The 
					curly brackets, {}, show that everything inside is part of one argument. So, in the above example, we are 
					solving two equations simultaneously -- {f,g} -- and two variables -- {x,y}. Notice every piece is separated 
					by a comma.</p>
					
					<p>Solve doesn't work for every equation out there, though. Sine, cosine, and tangent functions have infinite 
					answers, and Maple doesn't want to return an infinite number of answers any more than you want to read that many. 
					For this, you must use the 'fsolve' command. Fsolve still takes two arguments, but this time the second is 
					more than just the variable you're solving for - it's the variable and a range.</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart<br>
						f:=sin(2t)<br>
						solve(f=1,t)<br>
						fsolve(f=1,t=0..4)
					</blockquote>
					<p>Please take notice that two periods are used to show a range. The range, in English, is 't equals zero to 
					four', where the 'to' is represented by two periods. Fsolve also converts your answer to floating point, or decimal
					form.</p>
