                    <h3>Formatting Maple Documents</h3>

                    <p>Keyboard shortcuts can make your life easier once you memorize them all. These are all pretty
                        simple and I don't feel like they need much explanation. If you want further help, as always,
                        please feel free to contact me via the link at the bottom.</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>Control + period</dt>
                        <dd>Create new heading</dd>
                        <dt>Control + comma</dt>
                        <dd>back one heading</dd>
                        <dt>Control + t:</dt>
                        <dd>Switch to text mode (this can be used for inserting comments or typing English)</dd>
                        <dt>Control + m</dt>
                        <dd>Switch to unformatted math-type mode (this is easy to spot as your text will be bright red).
                            Most of the shortcuts that you may have become used to with math-type will no longer work in
                            this mode. A space will no long multiply two variables and semi-colans <i>must</i> be placed
                            at the end of every line, to signify the end of a command.
                            <br>
                            <small>Note: If you're having trouble debugging, try typing your commands in this mode.
                                Errors in your code are far more visible like this, however your homework will look like
                                a program, not a math assignment.
                            </small>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Control + r:</dt>
                        <dd>Switch to formatted math-type</dd>
                        <dt>Control + j:</dt>
                        <dd>Insert a new line below the current selection</dd>
                        <dt>Control + k:</dt>
                        <dd>Insert a new line above the current selection</dd>
                        <dt>Control + delete:</dt>
                        <dd>Delete the current line (Note: To delete multiple lines, highlight them and use backspace)
                        </dd>
                        <dt>evalf(___)</dt>
                        <dd>There are lots of eval_ commands. Evalf will covert anything inside the parenthesis to
                            decimal points. This can also be accomplished by adding a decimal point to the end of any
                            number in your function or equation. If any numbers have a decimal point, Maple will return
                            everything in decimal form.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>simplify(___)</dt>
                        <dd>Sometimes, Maple gets confused and doesn't realize that it can cancel terms out. Simplify
                            will force it to find any such terms and do such. If your answer is ugly, always try
                            simplify first.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Shift + enter, followed by: control + t</dt>
                        <dd>Shift + enter is used in lots of programs to create a new line. In Maple, it can be used in
                            conjunction with text mode to write in-line comments. This is very useful for explaining
                            your work as you go.

                    <p>Below are some guidelines for formatting your papers and homework assignments:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begin with your name. Switch to normal text mode (control + t) and type your name. Press
                            enter, and type your class and professor. On the third line, give the date or homework
                            assignment (or both).
                        </li>
                        <li>Create a new line (control + j) and create a new heading for the first problem (control +
                            period). Enter "Problem 1" or something equally undescriptive and then select the line
                            beneath it. If it is a multi-step problem, create another new heading for the first part.
                        </li>
                        <li>When you're done with the first part, create a new line and then return one heading (control
                            + comma) and then immediately create another new heading, for the second part of the problem
                            (control + period).
                        </li>
                        <li>When the entire problem is complete, create one more new line and return as many headings as
                            necessary to get back to the left-hand side of the document. Then create one more heading
                            for the next problem.
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep yourself organized by left-clicking the line flowing down from each heading. This will
                            hide everything under that heading for the time being, until you left-click it again. Be
                            careful though - if you print with some headings collapsed, they will not re-expand when
                            they reach the printer! You'll need to expand all headings before going to the printer.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
