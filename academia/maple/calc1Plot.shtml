					<h3>Calculus 1/Algebra: Plot</h3>
					
					<p>Plotting a function is one of the most basic things you'll be asked to do, and with the higher 
					resolution on your monitor (as opposed to a TI-8X), graphs are actually useful. Here's the basics:</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart
						<br>y:=1/2*x^2+3
						<br>plot(y,x=-5..5)
					</blockquote>
					<p>The plot command can take a lot of various arguments, but the two mains ones you will need to 
					concern yourself with are the first two: y -- the function you are plotting, and x=-5..5 -- the 
					independent variable (x-axis) and its range. Like many other commands, Maple will assume some 
					arguments if they're left out. Try the command: <span id="code">plot(y)</span>. Notice it assumed 
					you wanted x to be your independent variable, and it auto-calculated the range. If you don't know 
					what a function looks like, this can be a good place to start. Then go back and edit the range until 
					you have what you need.</p>
					
					<p>If you need to compare two or more functions on one graph, this is also easily done.</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						z:=1/3*x^2
						plot({y,z},x=-5..5)
					</blockquote>
					
					<p>A list of the extra arguments available are provided below:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>color=[color1,color2]</dt>
							<dd>This will set the color of your lines. When using this argument, be sure to also wrap your 
							functions in square brackets rather than curly brackets. Curly brackets tells Maple you don't 
							care about the order of what is inside, square brackets are the opposite. Try experimenting 
							with curly brackets	and square brackets to find out for yourself.</dd>
						<dt>numpoints=X</dt>
							<dd>Some functions move very rapidly, and will display a jagged line, such as exponentials. 
							This forces Maple to use a higher resolution (calculate more points on the graph). Experiment 
							with different numbers for "X" until you find a graph that is both reasonably smooth, and 
							reasonably fast to load. If you start with a very high number, Maple will take a looong time 
							draw the graph. Just be patient - it will eventually finish.</dd>
						<dt>title="Cool Graph"</dt>
							<dd>Not much to this one. It adds a title to your graph. Don't forget the quotes though, or 
							it will try to display in math-type (which isn't a problem if that's what you're looking for).</dd>
						<dt>labels=["x","y"]</dt>
							<dd>If you need to label your axis, try this one. Be sure to use square brackets on this, or
							you might end up mixing your axis. Also feel free to replace "x" or "y" with "time" or "money" 
							or "pounds" or whatever unit you're using.</dd>
					</dl>
					
					<p>You may also want to label your functions. The plot command does not have an argument for this 
					specifically, however if you click on the plot, you can then choosing "Drawing" from the top-center of 
					the window and select the text-box tool (capital "T" with a box around it). Click where you would 
					like to create a text box, use the shortcut for math-type (control + r) and type out your function. You 
					can then drag-and-drop the text box to a different position if need be. If you're not satisfied with 
					the way Maple displays the title, or axis labels, this is a way to show them with more control over 
					formatting.</p>
