					<h3>Miscellaneous Commands: With</h3>

					<p>Maple doesn't load every single command upon start-up. It loads all the basics - solve, subs,
						int, diff, fsolve, plot, and lots more - but that doesn't mean that's all of them. There are
						hundreds, probably thousands more commands out there. If you have Maple installed, you've
						probably got most of these. You load groups, or packages, of them at a time. To do this, we use
						the command "with".</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart
						<br>
						f := x+y=5
						<br>
						implicitplot(f,x=-5..5,y=-5..5)
					</blockquote>

					<p>Without loading the correct package, plots, the command doesn't do anything.

					<blockquote id="code">
						with(plots)
						<br>
						implicitplot(f,x=-5..5,y=-5..5)
					</blockquote>

					<p>First thing to note is the massive spell of blue words that Maple gives you when you load a new
						package. These are all the new commands now available to you (until you do your next
						restart).</p>

					<p>Now that we have the package loaded, a perfect plot of the function is drawn for us. You may only
						load one new package at a time - use of curly brackets to add a second package inside the same
						with command is not allowed.</p>

					<p>Adding a semi-colon to the end of your with commands is highly recommended. Most of the time, we
						don't care what commands are loaded, and so the multi-line list means nothing. This saves space
						and avoids adding any more confusion to your Maple code.</p>

					<blockquote id="code">
						restart;with(plots):
						<br>
						f := x+y=5
						<br>
						implicitplot(f,x=-5..5,y=-5..5)
					</blockquote>

					<p>Do please take notice: the colon at the end of the restart simply marks the end of a command,
						whereas the semi-colon at the end of with both marks the end of a command and says to hide the
						output of that command.</p>
