					<h3>Calculus 1/Algebra: Int</h3>

					<p>Int is the command you'll use nearly every time you open Maple. INTegration - pretty simple
						really, but there is more to it than with the diff command. There are times your teacher or
						professor might ask you to setup an integral, not evaluate it. In this case, do <i>not</i> use
						the graphical version of the command. You must type it out. See the below example:</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart
						<br>
						f:=x^2-5x+10
						<br>
						int(f,x)
						<br>
						Int(f,x) --- (take note, the 'I' here is capitalized)
					</blockquote>
					<p>The first argument is the function to be integrated - the second argument is your differential.
						If no range is specified, it is assume to be an indefinite integral, and will be evaluated as
						such. <span
								id="caution">BE VERY CAREFUL!!! Maple does not know about the integrating constant!</span>
						We all know that the integral of x is (1/2)*x^2+C... but Maple doesn't. Maple will not include
						the "+C". You need to add this in yourself.</p>

					<p>Definite integrals are very similar, just add a range to your variable as you would with fsolve,
						plot, or any other command of the sort.</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						int(f,x=0..3)
						<br>
						Int(f,x=0..3)
					</blockquote>

					<p>The int command is the first command we've run across that can utilize the Maple shortcut:
						control + space (add shift for Linux). To see this, type "int", and press control + space. A
						menu will appear with a selection of graphical commands that Maple thinks you might be trying to
						type. The first will be the indefinite integral, easy noted because there are no bounds are the
						integration symbol. The third is your definite integral, easily noted because of the
						place-holder bounds, a and b. Notice that, just like the graphical commands on the left-hand
						toolbar, there are place holders where they need to be. After the selecting your choice in the
						pop-up menu, the first place-holder will be highlighted. Type what needs to be there, and press
						tab to jump to the next place holder. If the place holder uses the same variable that you've
						previously defined, go ahead and tab to the next spot. When the integral looks correct, press
						enter as you would with any other command.</p>

					<p>Let's go through this again, step-by-step:</p>
					<ol id="lists">
						<li>Type "int"</li>
						<li>Press: Control + space (add shift for Linux)</li>
						<li>Enter your first place holder</li>
						<li>Tab to the next place holder</li>
						<li>Continue entering and tabbing until the command is complete</li>
						<li>Press enter to evaluate, as you would with any other command</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The purpose of the control + space shortcut is to keep your Maple work clean. Your math will be
						easily readable as Math, not as a programming language. Be warned though, the easier your math
						is to read and debug, the harder your Maple is to debug. If Maple makes an error, it is far
						harder to find out what went wrong when using graphical commands.</p>

					<p>Finally, double and triple integrals are done just the same:</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						g:=x^2*y+y^2+10
						<br>
						int(int(g,x),y)
						<br>
						Int(Int(g,x),y)
					</blockquote>
					<p>Add ranges to x and y if desired.</p>
