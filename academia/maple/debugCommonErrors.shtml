					<h3>Debugging: Common Errors</h3>

					<dl>
						<dt>The built-in Help</dt>
							<dd>Maple's built-in help is, unlike most built-in help databases, very useful. Access it one of
							three ways: Help -&#62; Maple Help, Cntrl + F1, or my preferred way, type "?____" where the blank space
							is any Maple command or math term you can think of. For instance, to learn some advanced features of
							the plot command, try typing and executing <span id="code">?plot</span>.</dd>

						<dt><span id="code">"Error, unable to match delimiters"</span></dt>
							<dd>By far, the most common mistake you'll make is with parenthesis. If Maple returns this error,
							then you've made a mistake with your parenthesis, curly	brackets, or square brackets. Go back
							through your code and re-check these items.
							<br>Tip: placing your cursor to the right of a closing bracket or left of an opening bracket will
							underline all text between that bracket and it's respective opening or closing bracket.</dd>

						<dt>Maple returns wrong answer &amp; contains variable name rather than numbers</dt>
							<dd>This most likely occurred because you did not start from your restart command. Maple does not have
							a set order which it follows. If you type a set of commands in the order you wish them to be carried out,
							YOU are in charge ensuring they are carried out in that order. You can not simply excecute the
							final line and assume all lines above it will be executed. Either begin execution at the necessary restart
							command and proceed executing all commands beneath it, or press the "!!!" button at the top, which will
							execute all commands from top to bottom in your entire worksheet. This can be a good way to ensure you
							have everything in order with restarts where they need to be.</dd>

						<dt>The command entered is returned without change</dt>
							<dd>Another one of the most common mistakes is forgetting to load a package. If Maple returns the exact
							command which you typed, most likely you've forgotten to load a package. For example, if your sheet looks
							like this:
							<br><img src="mapleImages/packageNotLoaded.jpg">
							<br>This means you forgot to add <span id="code">with(inttrans):</span> after your restart command. The
							laplace command has not been loaded into Maple yet.</dd>

						<dt>Copying and Pasting</dt>
							<dd>In short, don't. Copying and pasting while using math-type can screw you up and it's nearly impossible
							to find where Maple messed up. Do not attempt this if A) you're anything but a Maple pro, or B) you're
							tight for time and can't risk wasting any of that precious commodity on debugging.
							<br>However, if you, for some reason, decide to try it despite my warnings,	here are my finding so far.
							The problem I've run across when using copying &amp; pasting (and I have not figured out why this happens
							sometimes, and not all the time) is that Maple sees the pasted data as a separate command from the rest
							of your line. This is fairly easy to spot <b>once you're looking for it</b> because there will be a point
							in your line where you are unable to backspace any further. If you find that point, <b>delete the entire
							line</b> and try again, without copying and pasting. Assign a variable to the data you want to use, or just
							retype it all by hand.</dd>

						<dt><span id="code">"RootOf(_Z - BunchOfCrap)"</span></dt>
							<dd>Try using evalf on this. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't, chances are you did
							something wrong. Perhaps a math major would be able to tell you what this actually means - all I know is
							that there is some very complex function out there and my answers shouldn't look like it. Recheck your work
							and look for typos.</dd>

						<dt>Solve returns nothing</dt>
							<dd>The most common reason I've run across this error is because I'm trying to solve a system of equations
							without entering all of my variables in the second argument.
							<blockquote id="code">
								restart
								<br>f := sin(x)+exp((1/100)*y)
								<br>g := sin(y)+exp(-(1/100)*x)
								<br>evalf(solve({f = 1, g = 0}, x))
							</blockquote>
							In this case, you need to add the second variable to your solve command - Maple won't solve for <i>only</i>
							x.
							<blockquote id="code">
								<br>evalf(solve({f = 1, g = 0}, {x, y}))
							</blockquote></dd>

						<dt><span id="code">"Warning, solving for expressions other than names or functions is not recommended."</span></dt>
							<dd>By "not recommended" Maple actually means there is no way on Earth it's going to let you solve for that.
							Check your second argument and make sure you didn't make a typo. If that doesn't fix it, then you need to
							approach the problem a different way because Maple is not accepting your second argument.</dd>

						<dt><span id="code">"Error, invalid input: ______ expects ____ arguments, but received _____"</span></dt>
							<dd>To be honest, this could mean a lot of things. Compare your command with the examples I have here and make
							all your arguments agree with mine. If you're still having problems, please feel free to ask for further help
							or use Maple's built-in help command. Contact details are at the bottom, as always.</dd>
