					<h3>Differential Equations: Laplace Transforms</h3>
	
					<p>Oh Mr. Laplace. What were you smoking when you thought of this? Well, whatever. Here's how to do 
					Laplace transforms and inverse Laplace transforms nice and easy thanks to Maple.
					<br>If the first line confuses you, please see the page regarding loading <a href="with.shtml">
					new packages</a>.</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						restart;with(inttrans):
						<br>f:=cos(2*t)
						<br>F:=laplace(f,t,s)
						<br>g:=exp(-2*t)*t^2
						<br>G:=laplace(g,t,s)
					</blockquote>
					<p>Oh yea, there you have it. A Maple command that takes THREE arguments. The first is of course 
					the function you would like to be transformed, the second is the variable you are transforming, 
					the third is your choice of variable to transform into. In this case, I chose to go from the time 
					domain to the spacial domain. Perhaps you'd rather from variable1 to crackVariable2? Choose them 
					however you please - just make sure that the first one matches the variable in your function.</p>
					
					<p>To take the inverse, it's nearly the same:</p>
					<blockquote id="code">
						invlaplace(F,s,t)
						<br>invlaplace(G,s,t)
					</blockquote>
					<p>Simply add "inv" to the beginning for INVerse LAPLACE, and you're all set. Swap the s and the 
					t, since you're going backwards. This may show the answer in a different way than you wrote it down, 
					so try using an <a href="misc.shtml#is">"is"</a> statement to make sure you got it right.</p>
