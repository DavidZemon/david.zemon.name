				<h3>About Me</h3>
				
				<span style="text-align: center;">The boring stuff that says nothing about me:</span>
				
				<ul style="text-align: left; width: 25em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
					<li>David Zemon</li>
					<li>Class of 2013, acquiring B.S. in Computer Engineering</li>
					<li>Born and raised in St. Charles County, MO (suburb of St. Louis)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<span style="text-align: center;">The stuff that actually means something:</span>
				
				<p>Saabs and computers. You'll hear me talk a lot more about Saabs though. They're far easier to 
				get passionate about than computers. For those that are unaware, Saab is an automobile company. 
				They make cars that cater to drivers. They're not the fastest cars in the world. They're not 
				the cheapest (or the most expensive) cars in the world. They're not the most luxurious cars in 
				the world. They're not the largest and most spacious cars in the world. They are, however, the 
				best overall compromise of every aspect of any car I have yet to see. Every personal item I 
				own can be transported inside my Saab. The same Saab that gets 30.1 mpg going 75mph for 3.5 
				hours. The same Saab that flew me through the autocross track. The same (model) Saab that has 
				saved countless lives with its pioneering safety. This Saab is a driver's car. It's fun to drive.
				And damn do I have fun driving it!</p>
				
				<p>As I mentioned above, I also enjoy computers. But... I'll write more about that later.</p>
