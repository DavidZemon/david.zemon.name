				<p>Purchased in late fall of 2009 for $800, my '93 was one of my absolute favorites. With only 132,000
					miles, it was an excellent car and hopefully still is for its current owner. The excellent interior
					was matched perfectly with a dark, metallic green paint that enjoyed frequent hand waxes. She ran
					very strong with the 2.1L naturally aspirated engine and the low-end torque never ceased to amaze
					me. I write this now, two years after selling it, and have honestly forgotten most of what made her
					unique. Mostly what I remember is 100% reliability. In two years of driving, the only necessary
					repair was replacement of the passenger side inner-driver. The sale was made in early fall/late
					summer of 2011 to a friend of STL Swede Speed for $1,000.</p>
