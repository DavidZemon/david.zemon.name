				<p>Purchased as an upgrade from my '93, it has been a constant love/hate relationship with her. The
					purchase story has its own <a target="_blank"
												  href="http://saabguy.blogspot.com/2011/07/my-new-1991-saab-900-turbo.html">
						blog entry</a> on my [rarely used] blog. In short, I acquired her for $800 from Flint, Michigan
					and the fuel pump failed 60 miles out at 11pm on July 4, 2011. Since then, no major repairs have
					been necessary but I quickly discovered unacceptable frame rust at the passenger-side lower-front
					control arm mount. Combining that boost problems and general "so-so" condition, a replacement in the
					summer of 2013 should come as no surprise to anyone. 130,000 miles were on the clock at purchase and
					she now sits at aproximately 150,000. Many good parts were installed during my time with her, and I
					plan on taking every bit possible to be used on my next endeavour.</p>
