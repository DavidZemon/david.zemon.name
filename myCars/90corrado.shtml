				<h2>1990 Volkswagen Corrado G60</h2>

				<p>This was my second car - a 1990 Volkswagen Corrado G60. For it's day, and for the money, it couldn't
					be beaten. Still today it is considered an excellent sports car. It is not a drag car. The engine is
					big enough to be fun, but V8 or Saab turbo. The Corrado was a thorough-bred autocross car. With
					tight cornering stability and luxury options to compete with any of the premium brands from the era,
					I enjoyed every minute in the driver's seat of this beauty.</p>

				<p>I had to sell mine when the throw out bearing wore out. My dad didn't think the car was worth fixing,
					and so wouldn't give up his garage long enough for me to repair it. So, I sold it. That landed me
					with my third car, another SAAB! :D</p>
