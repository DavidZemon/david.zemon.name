    <h3>Functional Interface</h3>

    <p>Though the <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> didn't arrive until Java 8, the concept has been around far longer.
        When you have two similar methods where the only difference lies in the middle, you can use a functional
        interface combined with anonymous inner classes (or lambdas if available) to remove duplication.</p>
