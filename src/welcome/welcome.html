    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>David spends his free time participating in various motorsports, hiking, woodworking, cooking, and occasional
        personal software ventures. He is an avid fan of autocross, but partakes in the occasional road rally as
        well. He and his wife enjoy hiking through Missouri's beautiful hills and state parks, and then whipping up
        something fantastic in the kitchen later that evening. He also maintains the St. Louis Woodworkers Guild's
        <a target="_blank" href="https://slwg.org/">website</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/DavidZemon/jumpstart" target="_blank">Jumpstart</a></h3>

    <p>While working at Red Lion, David developed a template for new C and C++ projects. After introducing numerous
        new tools to the team (CMake, CPack, Conan, TeamCity), it became clear that fellow-teammates would
        appreciate a helping hand when starting new projects. After researching existing scaffolding frameworks, such
        Yeoman and Maven's archetypes, he decided it would be simpler to start from scratch with a basic templating
        engine like Django.</p>

    <p>Today, Jumpstart serves as the perfect jumping off point for any new C or C++ project, providing a
        well-organized folder structure and premiere support for the CMake build system and Conan dependency manager.
        The resulting project files will include unit tests linked against Google's GoogleTest framework and the
        necessary CPack incantations to generate a plethora of installation packages, including .deb and .rpm.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://david.zemon.name/PropWare/" target="_blank">PropWare</a></h3>

    <p>PropWare is a combination of three key pieces</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy, configurable and fast C++ objects for the Parallax Propeller (includes the C Simple Library from
            Parallax, libpropeller by SRLM, and my own PropWare namespace)
        </li>
        <li>An easy-to-use and robust build system using CMake</li>
        <li>Thorough documentation including examples and API docs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DIY Segway</h3>

    <p>Upon returning for his final semester at Missouri S&amp;T, David joined the DIY Segway team
        within IT Research Support Services. The Parallax Propeller was chosen as the MCU of choice due
        to its cost/performance ratio. With prior Propeller experience, available C libraries, and
        easy-to-use multi-core architecture, David was able to quickly get the project on track. He
        left the team with a prototype capable of short and lively rides.</p>

    <h3>Consumer Baseline Web Application</h3>

    <p>While interning with National Information Solutions Cooperative, David worked on a web
        application to display utility meter prediction data. Java, the Google Web Toolkit and Moxie
        Highcharts were used to display the predictions while the Java Cache class kept track of all
        recent queries. A custom class was also created to cache all queries in the browser tab, saving
        significant communication and processing time during resize events.</p>

    <h3>Visualizing 4 Dimensions in Rolla</h3>

    <p>V4DiR, in three words, is turn-key visualization. In January of 2012, David was offered a job
        with IT Research Support Services as part of a new student research group tasked with building a
        turn-key visualization tool. The goals were simple: make it easy to use and capable of rendering
        large datasets near real-time.</p>
