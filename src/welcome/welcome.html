    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>David spends most of his free time programming. PropWare is his biggest obsession, following that is food, cars
        and TV.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://david.zemon.name/PropWare/" target="_blank">PropWare</a></h3>

    <p>PropWare is a combination of three key pieces</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy, configurable and fast C++ objects for the Parallax Propeller (includes the C Simple Library from
            Parallax, libpropeller by SRLM, and my own PropWare namespace)
        </li>
        <li>An easy-to-use and robust build system using CMake</li>
        <li>Thorough documentation including examples and API docs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DIY Segway</h3>

    <p>Upon returning for his final semester at Missouri S&amp;T, David joined the DIY Segway team
        within IT Research Support Services. The Parallax Propeller was chosen as the MCU of choice due
        to its cost/performance ratio. With prior Propeller experience, available C libraries, and
        easy-to-use multi-core architecture, David was able to quickly get the project on track. He
        left the team with a prototype capable of short and lively rides.</p>

    <h3>Consumer Baseline Web Application</h3>

    <p>While interning with National Information Solutions Cooperative, David worked on a web
        application to display utility meter prediction data. Java, the Google Web Toolkit and Moxie
        Highcharts were used to display the predictions while the Java Cache class kept track of all
        recent queries. A custom class was also created to cache all queries in the browser tab, saving
        significant communication and processing time during resize events.</p>

    <h3>Visualizing 4 Dimensions in Rolla</h3>

    <p>V4DiR, in three words, is turn-key visualization. In January of 2012, David was offered a job
        with IT Research Support Services as part of a new student research group tasked with building a
        turn-key visualization tool. The goals were simple: make it easy to use and capable of rendering
        large datasets near real-time.</p>
