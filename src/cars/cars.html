    <h2>My Cars</h2>

    <p>I like cars. I also get bored, and like to change it up... often. Currently, I'm saving up for a Tesla. We'll
        see what the Model III ends up looking like - I may end up with one - but the Model S sure looks nice.</p>

    <p>For the moment, I'm pretty happy with my Volvo. The ride is pretty rough, but it was the right price and is a
        real pleasure to drive on smooth roads.</p>

    <p>Below, you'll find the full listing of cars that I've owned since turning 16. My earliest cars are at the
        top, and the Volvo finishes off the list at the bottom.</p>

    <p>This was my first car. My uncle gave it to me in May of 2007. It was his old car, and it was my 16th
        birthday present. This car was my true love until one terrible morning, I was rear ended on the way
        to school. Because these cars are monocoque, meaning the body panels are also the frame, the car was
        totaled.</p>

    <p>With the insurance money, I purchased Volkswagen's best-kept secret: a Corrado.</p>

    </a>

    <p>This was my second car - a 1990 Volkswagen Corrado G60. Still today it is considered an excellent sports car.
        It is not a drag car. The engine is big enough to be fun, but not a V8 or Saab turbo. The Corrado was a
        thorough-bred autocross car. With tight cornering stability and luxury options to compete with any of the
        premium brands from the era, I enjoyed every minute in the driver's seat of this beauty.</p>

    <p>Sold when the throwout bearing wore out, I look back at that Corrado with nothing but love and affection.</p>

    <p>This was my third car. Very much like my other Saabs, but it doesn't have leather seats (that's a
        plus in my opinion), only the driver's side window is one-touch down, the sun-roof is not electric,
        it produces about 15 less hp (B202 engine instead of B212), and that's about it. Most everything I
        know about cars I learned on this one. I did all sorts of repairs to this car including: head
        gasket, timing chain, transmission, and various other bits.</p>

    <p>Purchased in late fall of 2009 for $800, my '93 was one of my absolute favorites. With only 132,000
        miles, it was an excellent car and hopefully still is for its current owner. The excellent interior
        was matched perfectly with a dark, metallic green paint that enjoyed frequent hand waxes. She ran
        very strong with the 2.1L naturally aspirated engine and the low-end torque never ceased to amaze
        me. I write this now, two years after selling it, and have honestly forgotten most of what made her
        unique. Mostly what I remember is 100% reliability. In two years of driving, the only necessary
        repair was replacement of the passenger side inner-driver. The sale was made in early fall/late
        summer of 2011 to a friend of STL Swede Speed for $1,000.</p>

    <p>Purchased as an upgrade from my '93, it was a constant love/hate relationship. The
        purchase story has its own
        <a target="_blank" href="http://saabguy.blogspot.com/2011/07/my-new-1991-saab-900-turbo.html">blog
            entry</a> on my [rarely used] blog. In short, I acquired her for $800 from Flint, Michigan
        and the fuel pump failed 60 miles out at 11pm on July 4, 2011. Since then, no major repairs have
        been necessary but I quickly discovered unacceptable frame rust at the passenger-side lower-front
        control arm mount. Combining that with boost problems and general "so-so" condition, a replacement in the
        summer of 2013 should come as no surprise to anyone. 130,000 miles were on the clock at purchase and
        she was sold with 155,000. Many good parts were installed during my time with her, and overall she
        was a good, reliable car.</p>

    <h2>1989 Saab 900 SPG</h2>

    <p>$2,500, 267,000 miles, a broken power steering rack, bald tires, an interior anyone ought to be
        ashamed of... SPG. Saab created a tuned version of the 900 known as the "SPG", or "Special
        Performance Group" that put out 175 HP and 195 lb-ft of torque. Combine that with stiffer springs
        and other beautiful details and the result is a highly sought after collector's item. My love affair
        continued with this gem. Hindsight 20/20, it wasn't the deal-of-a-lifetime I thought at first.</p>
