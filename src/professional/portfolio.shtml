                    <h3>DIY Segway</h3>

                    <p>Upon returning for his final semester at Missouri S&amp;T, David joined the DIY Segway team
                        within IT Research Support Services. The Parallax Propeller was chosen as the MCU of choice due
                        to its cost/performance ratio. With prior Propeller experience, available C libraries, and
                        easy-to-use multi-core architecture, David has been able to quickly get the project on track.
                        Work is still in progress, so please feel free to request further information.</p>

                    <h3>Consumer Baseline Web Application</h3>

                    <p>While interning with National Information Solutions Cooperative, David worked on a web
                        application to display utility meter prediction data. Java, the Google Web Toolkit and Moxie
                        Highcharts were used to display the predictions while the Java Cache class kept track of all
                        recent queries. A custom class was also created to cache all queries in the browser tab, saving
                        significant communication and processing time during resize events.</p>

                    <p>V4DiR, in three words, is turn-key visualization. In January of 2012, David was offered a job
                        with IT Research Support Services as part of a new student research group tasked with building a
                        turn-key visualization tool. The goals were simple: make it easy to use and capable of rendering
                        large datasets near real-time.</p>
