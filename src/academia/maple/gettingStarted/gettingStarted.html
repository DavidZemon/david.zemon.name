    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <p>Maple works via a series of commands, and after every command it returns a result. You can tell Maple to add,
        subtract, multiply, divide, and so much more. For starters, try the following, pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> after
        each line:</p>

    <p>*Note: You do not need to include spaces</p>

<pre>
    2 + 2
    5^2
    10^10
    24288/352
    1000!
    (x + 5)^2
</pre>

    <p>As you can see, your commands are black text, formatted very similarly to the way math is written on paper.
        The result, or the answer, is then returned in blue, centered on the page, one line below the command. Now,
        let's say you have a multi-step process that must be completed, and you wish to show all your work. Let's use
        the following example:</p>

    <p>Solve for <var>x</var>: <code>4x/57-80=0</code></p>
<pre>
    f := 4x/57 - 80 = 0
    h := f + 80
    g := h*57
    j := g/4
</pre>

    <p>Notice how the <code>:=</code> assigns a function, variable, or number to another variable. You can also use
        variable names such as <var>step1</var>, <var>step2</var>, <var>answer</var>, <var>MapleHatesMe</var> and
        many others. Some names not suggested are: <var>I</var>, <var>D</var>, and any Maple command (which you will
        begin to learn in the next section).</p>

    <p>Inevitably, a time will come when you want to reuse a variable. To ensure your variables are not carried over
        from one problem to another, begin every problem with the <code>restart</code> command. <code>restart</code>
        clears all variables and closes any packages which you previously opened (you will learn about extra packages
        later as well).</p>
