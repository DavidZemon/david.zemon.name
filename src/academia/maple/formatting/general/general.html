    <h2>Formatting: General</h2>

    <p>Formatting is key if you plan on receiving any credit for your work. People, be they your
        teacher, professor, grader, peer, or what have you, <i>must</i> be able to read your work. This
        page will show you how to format your work in a way that is easy and quick to read. I'll also
        give you tips in formatting to avoid errors.</p>

        <dt>Collapsible Headings</dt>
        <dd>My favorite part of Maple is the inclusion of collapsible headings. To create a new heading,
            use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>CTRL + PERIOD</kbd>. If you've already started
            your problem and have many lines of code, highlight them all and press <kbd>CTRL + PERIOD</kbd>.
            Download an example of how I use collapsible headings <a href="assets/Notes.mw">here</a>.

            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"><span
                        aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button>
                <b>Info!</b> To undo a heading, use <kbd>CTRL + COMMA</kbd>.
