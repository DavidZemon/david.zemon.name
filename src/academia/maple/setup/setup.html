    <h2>First Time Setup</h2>


    <ol>
        <ol>
        <li>Open Maple. If there is a window with one of those check boxes that make it never show up
            again... I suggest clicking the check box.
        </li>
        <li>At the top menu, choose "Tools -&#62; Options"</li>
        <li>Choose the third tab "Interface"</li>
        <li>Select the drop down menu with description: "Default format for new worksheets" and choose
            "Worksheet" instead of the default, "Document"
        </li>
        <li>At the bottom, click "Apply globally"</li>
        <li>Close Maple and reopen it</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here you will find commands to try and tricks to making Maple do your bidding. For those with programming
        experience, think of Maple as just another programming language. Learn the language and you'll do fine.</p>

    <p>To start, try using simple calculator commands that you might use on a TI-30 or the like. If you
        need something more complex, use the graphical functions in the left-hand tool bar. If you have
        specific questions, as always, feel free to contact me.asdf</p>
