    <h2>Academia</h2>

    <p>This section of my website has been reserved for all things academic. This currently includes a grade
        sheet with which you can easily keep track of your grades and find out whether you are on track with
        your goals. It also includes instructions which will guide you through using a math program known as
        Maple. I hope you find the information here useful and constructive. If there is something you'd
        like to see added, please let me know.</p>
